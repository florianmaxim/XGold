    As a metaphor, jungle often refers to situations that are
    unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to
    be “survival of the fittest”. This reflects the view of “city
    people” that forests are such places. Upton Sinclair gave
    the title The Jungle (1906) to his famous book about the
    life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards portraying the
    workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or
    other lawful recourse.
    The term "The Law of the Jungle" is also used in a similar
    context, drawn from Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book
    (1894) — though in the society of jungle animals portrayed
    in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for
    human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code
    of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to
    a lawless chaos.
    The word “jungle” itself carries connotations of untamed
    and uncontrollable nature and isolation from
    civilisation, along with the emotions that evokes:
    threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation and
    immobilisation. The change from “jungle” to
    “rainforest” as the preferred term for describing tropical
    forests as has been a response to an increasing perception
    of these forests as fragile and spiritual places, a
    viewpoint not in keeping with the darker connotations of
    “jungle”.
